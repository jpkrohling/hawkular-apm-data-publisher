= Hawkular APM - Backend - Data Publisher

This is the Data Publisher component for Hawkular APM backend. This is responsible for receiving data from the
collector and sending it for the persistence component. Alternatively, this component could listen to a stream
source and send relevant events to the persistence component.

== How to build this from the sources

To generate a TAR and ZIP distribution files, run:
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew build

To generate `install` directory, run:
[source,bash]

With an install directory, a Docker image can be generated as:
[source,bash]

[source,bash]
